Conversion from TensorFlow to CoreML in Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/frogermcs/TF-to-CoreML/blob/master/notebooks/Core_ML_export.ipynb)

Example project showing how to convert TensorFlow model to CoreML. This repository includes two notebooks:
- Conversion from TL to CoreML that can be run on Colaboratory ([notebook](https://github.com/frogermcs/TF-to-CoreML/blob/master/notebooks/Core_ML_export.ipynb)).
- Comparing TensorFlow and CoreML models that can be run only on macOS because of [coremltools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools) limitations ([notebook](https://github.com/frogermcs/TF-to-CoreML/blob/master/notebooks/Core_ML_inspection.ipynb)).
